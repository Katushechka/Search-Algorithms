# Search-Algorithms


Two algorithms are implemented for the multiple knapsack problem:
1. a greedy algorithm, and
2. an improving search (neighborhood search) algorithm.

## The knapsack problem
**The standard knapsack problem** assumes that there is a set of items, each with a (positive) weight and a (positive) value, and a knapsack (or bag) with a
limited weight capacity. The problem is to choose (to include in the knapsack)
items so that the weight capacity of the knapsack is not violated and the value
of the chosen items are as high as possible.\
**The multiple knapsack problem** is an extension to the standard knapsack problem in that it considers choosing items to include in *m* knapsacks (the standard
knapsack problem considers only one knapsack).
